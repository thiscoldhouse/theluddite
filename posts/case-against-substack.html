  Like so many other bad things in our world, it all starts with tech investors. Tech valuations are through the roof right now. If you start a company that needs venture capital, you'll have to sit down and tell investors what you think it will be worth. You make a spreadsheet with projected revenue, expenses, etc., and then you arrive at a number. Then you multiply that number by an industry specific multiplier. That multiplier is supposed to determine how much capital markets value that industry. If you have a tech company and a laundromat chain whose details are otherwise identical, the infallible wisdom of the market tells us that the tech company is worth a whole lot more - like a ton more.

  This means tech companies (and those claiming to be tech companies - put a pin in that) can raise an insane amount of money on very little. These companies don't usually need a lot of capital to buy equipment or do R&D or whatever. Most tech companies these days are just making a website where they resell goods someone else is making, whether those goods be physical goods or other people's writing. When these companies get a lot of money, since they don't need that cash to really do anything, they use their cash to offer whatever good they're selling artificially cheap, eventually becoming a pointless middleman in an industry that they've now cornered.

  Have you ever wondered why all the podcast ads are so similar? Every company is "____ as a service," because they are trying to convince investors that they are a tech company. BetterHelp isn't a therapy company; Quip isn't a toothbrush company; Hello Fresh isn't a grocery company. They all want to be the next Uber, which isn't a cab company. All these companies always structure themselves the same way: it's a subscription, not a product; they offer a whole two weeks free when you sign up with the offer code. It's the tech company model of acquiring users and figuring out how to make money later.

In a way, Substack is the purest version of this. They are just the internet as a service.
</p>
<p>
  Substack has raised more than $80 million dollars. What does substack do that requires that much capital? They aren't building factories or doing any R&D. They have raised that money to take over as much of the internet as possible as fast as possible. They will offer big names undisclosed sums of money to write on their site. They'll let writers monetize their substack at a subsidized rate.

</p>
<p>
  Substack is an attempt to make a small internet within the bigger internet. They are doing nothing worthwhile. They are yet another tech company that is raising capital to mine the value that truly visionary technologists who made the open internet passed down to us.
