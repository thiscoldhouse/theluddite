  Paul Graham is probably the single most influential investor in tech. If you start a software company, especially one that might require some sort of capital investment, everyone will tell you to read his essays. He's revered like some sort of saint. It is impossible to overstate his influence among aspiring silicon valley entrepreneurs.
</p>
<p>
  He's also the corporeal manifestation of so much that is wrong about the technology world. There's this attitude in tech that social problems are an annoyance; they shouldn't concern hackers because they're just out there making cool shit or whatever. You know the attitude - Facebook will say it's not their fault that people will use Facebook to start a genocide; tech companies can't help it that there aren't more women programmers; etc. Paul Graham probably didn't invent that, but he codified and legitimized it for tech bros everywhere. He has spent decades spreading it through Y-combinator, his startup incubator.
</p>
<p>
  Y-combinator is like the Vatican of tech entrepreneurship. It is the single most influential organization in the startup world. Lots of the biggest tech companies, like <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/" target="_blank" >airbnb, dropbox, substack, instacart, and reddit,</a> got their start at Y-combinator. Even more huge companies applied and didn't get in, but still followed its advice closely. Companies that are accepted are usually given the same advice: spend as much time with Paul Graham as humanly possible.
</p>
<p>
  If Y-combinator is his church, then <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">his "essays"</a> are its scriptures. In them, he gives advice to aspiring Zuckerbergs everywhere. His advice is small-minded, ultra-capitalist, sexist, racist, and xenophobic. He gives "realist" advice, without the necessary self-reflection that, of all people, he is the single person most in the position to change these so-called realities.
</p>
<p>
  In his various works, <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201309/issie-lapowsky/how-paul-graham-became-successful.html">he advises companies to have someone who doesn't have an accent as their CEO, because that's what investors like</a>. He reminds people that, while you can't legally discriminate when hiring employees, you can totally pick your cofounders however you want (pregnant people? Fuck 'em!). He talks about how there's nothing that he, or Y-combinator, could possibly do to fix their gender ratio, because the problem is "upstream" from them.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes, the stupid shit he says triggers a backlash, and sometimes it doesn't. When there is a backlash, he'll publish <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wids.html">an essay defending himself</a>, and lots of folks will rally to him. Maybe each of the statements on their own may be defensible, but taken in their totality: he's a rich, influential person who propagates a destructive culture and refuses to accept any responsibility associated with his incredible wealth and influence.
</p>
<p>
As bad as the racist or xenophobic stuff he's said can be, I don't even think that's his worst quality. I want to end with his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html">furthering of the cult of perpetual growth</a>. He's a big force behind the tech obsession with "unicorns." In tech jargon, a unicorn is a company that is worth a billion dollars. Venture capital in tech exclusively cares about unicorns, because sustainable businesses are a waste of time for investors. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html">In his words:</a>
</p>
<p>
  <i>The total value of the companies we've funded is around 10 billion, give or take a few. But just two companies, Dropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters of it.</i>
</p>
<p>
  I think this is the single most important thing to understand about the tech scene: it's even more capitalist than you think. You cannot start a software startup to just be a sustainable business; the ecosystem will reject you. Every single tech company has to become a unicorn or it is considered a failure. Paul Graham has turned that idea into a cult in tech, and its consequences are the technology world we are all forced to live with today.
