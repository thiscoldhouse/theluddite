  How many tech companies have raised how many billions if not trillions of dollars promising us that they can fix some climate change thing? Maybe some tiny, tiny percentage of that was well spent, but we all know that the vast majority of that was waste. We keep doing it because we want to believe the people who tell us that their startup can solve climate change without us having to change our lives, so as a society, we "invest" in smart window panes that can harvest solar energy or autonomous tree planting drones or whatever other boondoggle these founders come up wit.

  We have all the technology we need to stop climate change. We know what we have to do - we need to burn fewer fossil fuels. We don't need venture capital backed startups to make unicorn dust window pane solar paneled drone water filtration tree planting systems. Had we spent all that money overhauling our entire infrastructure from using fossil fuels to renewables, we wouldn't be where we are today.

  Tech startups are a flawed and harmful organizational structure. The tech industry is rotten. Its obsession with growth at all costs has managed to turn even innocuous ideas, like a website where you can share photos and keep in touch with friends, into existential threats to global democracy. If tech companies can manage to turn everything they touch into hate-mongering, privacy-destroying machines that turns our uncles into racist conspiracy theorists, why on earth should we let them anywhere near climate policy?

  For ten years, I was an engineer in startups in several fields: robotics, education, security, etc. In that time, I saw every startup I worked at start with a mission I agreed with and end up somewhere I didn't like. Every single one did that. It was always so baffling, until I realized that the point of a startup is to make money for its investors and founders--in that order. That's it. I'm embarrassed that it took me many years to learn that, including two startups of my own.

  Startups are controlled entirely by their investors and founders. Even the very first employee is rarely offered more a couple percent equity. That means the mission of the startup is whatever the founders and investors negotiate it to be. The more capital a startup raises, the more it is controlled by investors than by the founders.

  All of those dedicated engineers, researchers, scientists, and support staff--the people who signed up to make the technology because they believe in the mission--they don't get a say in how the company is run. If, after 10 years, an oil company wants to buy the startup and never use most of the tech, it will happen. All that IP from that R&D is now gone forever. All those late nights coding were just to make the investors wealthier. A company's mission will always be more flexible than its profit motive.

  All this is not to say that technology cannot help those who are doing something about climate change. Technology is a tool, and much like hammers will not solve climate change for us, we can use hammers to aid us in our goals. If there is a real use for technology in the fight to halt human-caused mass extinction, it should be made with, controlled by, and accountable to those who can wield it.
