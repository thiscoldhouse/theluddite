  How many tech companies have raised how many billions if not trillions of dollars promising us that they can fix some climate change thing? Maybe some tiny, tiny percentage of that was well spent, but we all know that the vast majority of that was waste. We keep doing it because we want to believe the people who tell us that their startup can solve climate change without us having to change our lives, so as a society, we "invest" in smart window panes that can harvest solar energy or autonomous tree planting drones or whatever other boondoggle these founders come up wit.

  So long as tech continues to convince the public that a technological solution will solve our societal problem, we won't build the political will to change how we live. Why stop producing plastics when they're making a robot that will clean up all the plastic in the ocean? Why stop burning fossil fuels when they're working on large carbon capturing robots that will simply take the carbon out of the air? Why restructure the economy when we can just buy carbon offsets?

  Most climate tech is a con. A good con finds a mark that wants to believe. All of us want to believe that we can widget and robot our way out of this, but we can't. That's the danger with con artists. If someone believes a faith healer will heal their cancer, they lose valuable time that actual real doctors could've used to help. We don't need venture capital backed startups to make unicorn dust window pane solar paneled drone water filtration tree planting systems. Had we spent all that money overhauling our entire infrastructure from using fossil fuels to renewables, we wouldn't be where we are today.

  Tech startups are a flawed and harmful organizational structure. The tech industry is rotten. Its obsession with growth at all costs has managed to turn even innocuous ideas, like a website where you can share photos and keep in touch with friends, into existential threats to global democracy. If tech companies can manage to turn everything they touch into hate-mongering, privacy-destroying machines that turns our uncles into racist conspiracy theorists, why on earth should we let them anywhere near climate policy?

  For ten years, I was an engineer in startups in several fields: robotics, education, security, etc. In that time, I saw every startup I worked at start with a mission I agreed with and end up somewhere I didn't like. Every single one did that. It was always so baffling, until I realized that the point of a startup is to make money for its investors and founders--in that order. That's it. I'm embarrassed that it took me many years to learn that, including two startups of my own.

  Startups are controlled entirely by their investors and founders. Even the very first employee is rarely offered more a couple percent equity. That means the mission of the startup is whatever the founders and investors negotiate it to be. The more capital a startup raises, the more it is controlled by investors than by the founders.
</p>
<p>
  All of those dedicated engineers, researchers, scientists, and support staff--the people who signed up to make the technology because they believe in the mission--they don't get a say in how the company is run. If, after 10 years, an oil company wants to buy the startup and never use most of the tech, it will happen. All that IP from that R&D is now gone forever. All those late nights coding were just to make the investors wealthier. A company's mission will always be more flexible than its profit motive.
</p>
<p>
  All this is not to say that technology cannot help those who are doing something about climate change. Technology is a tool, and much like hammers will not solve climate change for us, we can use hammers to aid us in our goals. If and when there is a real use for technology in the fight to halt the destruction of the only planet in the entire universe habitable by human beings, it should be controlled by and accountable to humanity, not founders or investors.
