    The Luddites were textile workers. In 1812, Ned Lud, from whom the Luddites take their name, wrote the following:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Whereas by the charter granted by our late sovereign Lord Charles II by the Grace of God King of Great Britain France and Ireland, the framework knitters are empowered to break and destroy all frames and engines that fabricate articles in a fraudulent and deceitful manner and to destroy all framework knittersâ€™ goods whatsoever that are so made...</i>
  </p>

    They destroyed machines not because they hated textiles or automation, but because machines were being used to oppress workers, or as they put it, "in a fradulent and decitful manner." The Luddites understood that any piece of technology is neither good nor bad - it is just a tool. If a tool is used to oppress, then it should be destroyed.

    The internet, much like the physical world, is a wonderful place full of resources and opportunity. How we choose to use them is one of the biggest questions of our time. The media usually covers technology by interviewing investors, founders, and CEOs, presenting an impoverished view of technology and its role in society. I hope to add a dissenting voice to the discussion about the future of our technological world that emphasizes public good over private profit.
