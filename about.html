    The internet, much like the physical world, is a wonderful place full of resources and opportunity. How we choose to use them is one of the biggest questions of our time. The media usually covers technology by interviewing investors, founders, and CEOs, presenting an impoverished view of technology and its role in society. I hope to add a dissenting voice to the discussion about the future of our technological world.
