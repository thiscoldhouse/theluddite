  I'm not on social media. If you'd like to get an email when I've written something new, <a href="mailto:subscribe@theluddite.org?subject=TheLuddite.org&body=Subscribe.">click this mailto link</a> or send an email to subscribe@theluddite.org. I will only email you when I've written something new, and in case it's not obvious from the rest of my blog, I won't ever share your emails with anyone.
